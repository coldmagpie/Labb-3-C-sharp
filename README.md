# Lab3 â€“ Quiz game!
##This was our last main project of the C# course. In this project we used WPF to create a Quiz game, and It's also the first time we began to use UI instead of console application.##

*I know the UI is catastrophe but it did work! I'm proud of my self anyway and I promise I'll do it better in later couses:)*
